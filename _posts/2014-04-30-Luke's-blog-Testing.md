Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This progress of creating my blog, is based on the [guid](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
